Build me a modern, clean, interactive full-stack web app called "LeetTrack: Daily Reps to Internships." This is a motivational LeetCode tracker specifically for aspiring software engineers like me.

The goal is to help me *track, stay consistent, and visualize* my LeetCode progress as I work toward getting software engineering internships.

💻 Features and Pages:

1. **Home Dashboard**
   - Shows total problems solved
   - Shows today's reps completed out of my goal (e.g., "3/5 done today!")
   - Shows streaks (e.g., "You're on a 4-day streak!")
   - Progress bar or chart of problems solved per day/week
   - Show motivational message when I hit my reps (like “🔥 You’re on fire!”)

2. **Problem Log Page**
   - List of all problems I’ve solved
   - Table should include:
     - Problem title
     - Difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)
     - Pattern/Topic (e.g., Sliding Window, DFS, Two Pointers)
     - Date solved
     - Reps (number of times I’ve repeated the problem)
     - Status (Solved, Need Review)
   - I should be able to add, edit, or delete entries here (CRUD functionality)
   - Include a "Mark as Reviewed" button per problem

3. **Filters and Search**
   - I should be able to filter problems by:
     - Difficulty
     - Pattern
     - Status
     - Reps
     - Date range
   - Also include a search bar to find problems by name

4. **Goal Setting Page**
   - Set custom daily rep goals (e.g., "5 reps a day")
   - Option to change this anytime
   - Set longer-term goals (e.g., “Finish 100 problems in 30 days”)
   - Show goal progress bars

5. **Motivation Page**
   - Display a random motivational quote each day
   - Track when I hit streaks or big milestones
   - Include celebratory messages and animations when goals are hit

6. **Settings Page**
   - Dark mode toggle
   - Set name or nickname for personalized greetings
   - Reset data option

🧠 Behavior and Logic:

- The dashboard updates live as I log problems or hit reps
- Problems solved today count toward daily goal
- When I hit my daily rep goal, I should see an animated congratulatory message
- When I miss a day, my streak breaks and it tells me to “Get back up!”

🎨 Design Requirements:

- Theme: LeetCode-style — clean, white background with pops of orange, black, and dark gray
- Use a sleek, minimal design — avoid anything rainbow-colored or messy
- Use modern fonts and layout — like Google’s Material UI or Tailwind CSS
- Make sure it’s mobile-friendly (responsive design)

🛠️ Tech Stack Requirements:

- Full-stack JavaScript (or TypeScript if supported)
- Use React for the frontend
- Use a backend framework (e.g., Node.js with Express)
- Store data in a JSON file or use a lightweight database like SQLite or Firebase (whichever Replit AI prefers)
- Make the site fully interactive and editable — I should be able to:
  - Add new problems
  - Set/change goals
  - View and filter logs
  - See my progress update live

📌 Final Notes:

- I should be able to use this on Replit with no extra setup
- Store data persistently if possible
- Keep the code modular and clean so I can expand it in the future

Please generate all the code and files needed (frontend, backend, styling) and include instructions on how to run it inside Replit. Make sure it’s working and live on first run.
