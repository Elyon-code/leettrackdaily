Please add the following features and enhancements to my existing "LeetTrack: Daily Reps to Internships" web app to help me better track and improve my LeetCode practice. The app is for personal use only, so no login/authentication is needed, and all data should persist locally or with lightweight backend as appropriate.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **In-built timer per problem:**
- On the Problem Log page, add a "Start Timer" button next to each problem entry.
- When clicked, allow me to select a timer duration (e.g., 30, 45, 60 minutes) and show a visible countdown.
- Display a "Time's up!" notification or modal when timer finishes.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Math logic for reps/day recalibration:**
- In the Goal Manager, automatically calculate and display how many problems per day I must solve to meet my active goal, based on target problem count and days remaining.
- Dynamically adjust this required reps/day value if I get ahead or fall behind schedule.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Email reminder system:**
- Add a "Set Reminder" button for both goals and individual problems.
- When clicked, let me enter a date/time for a reminder.
- Implement basic email reminder functionality using Nodemailer (or similar) with SMTP (or Mailgun API).
- Store my preferred reminder email address in Settings.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Reviewed Solutions fields:**
- In the Problem Log entry form, add two new editable textareas:
  - "Reviewed Solution #1 Notes"
  - "Reviewed Solution #2 Notes"
- These notes should save and be displayed along with each problem entry.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Pattern Vault filtering:**
- On the Pattern Mastery page, implement clickable filters at the top for pattern names.
- When a pattern is clicked, show only logged problems tagged with that pattern.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Milestone celebrations:**
- Add a celebratory animation (e.g., confetti or popup) when I:
  - Complete my daily rep goal
  - Reach 50% or 100% of a larger goal
  - Hit streak milestones (e.g., 3-day streak, 7-day streak, etc.)

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Streak tracking and persistence:**
- Accurately track and persist my current streak:
  - Increment streak when reps met on consecutive days
  - Reset streak to 0 if I miss a day
  - Show streak on Dashboard prominently.

8Ô∏è‚É£ **Motivational quote rotation:**
- Display a new motivational quote each day at the top of the Dashboard.
- Rotate through a predefined list of at least 10 inspirational quotes.

üí° Additional requirements:
- All new features must maintain the current polished LeetCode-inspired UI style and dark mode theme.
- The app must remain fully editable and interactive: I should be able to add/edit/delete problems, edit goals, and everything should update visually.
- Ensure everything is mobile-friendly and persists my data correctly.

---

üì¶ Deployment notes:
- This must work immediately inside Replit and require no additional setup by me.
- Keep the code modular and easy to extend further in the future.
